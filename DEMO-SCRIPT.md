# Argus Demo Script (3 Minutes)

*Target: ~450 words @ 150 wpm*
*Core themes: TRUST, PRIVACY, TRUTH*

---

## OPENING HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

**NARRATION:**
> "In 2024, 78% of people couldn't tell real news from misinformation. Not because they weren't smart—but because they had no way to know who to trust. What if trust wasn't a guess? What if it was *proven*?"

**📹 SCREEN RECORDING:**
- *Stock footage or quick montage of conflicting headlines, "BREAKING" chaos*

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:45)

**NARRATION:**
> "The information crisis isn't about too little information—it's about too little *trust*. Mainstream sources get things wrong. Alternative sources have agendas. And the people who actually *know* what's happening—journalists in conflict zones, researchers facing censorship, insiders risking their careers—they can't speak up. Because speaking up could cost them everything."

> "We don't have a content problem. We have a trust problem. And a protection problem."

**📹 SCREEN RECORDING:**
- *Stock footage or skip — this is context-setting*

---

## INTRODUCING ARGUS (0:45 - 1:05)

**NARRATION:**
> "Argus is built on two principles: *prove trust, protect truth-tellers*."

> "Every source earns its reputation through accuracy—not popularity, not algorithms. Cross a line into misinformation? Your score drops. Consistently verify? You rise. Trust isn't assumed. It's *earned and proven*."

**📹 SCREEN RECORDING SEQUENCE:**
1. Open https://argus.vitalpoint.ai → show landing page (2 sec)
2. Login → Dashboard with article feed
3. Hover over articles showing confidence scores and source reliability ratings

---

## FEATURE 1: VERIFIED INTELLIGENCE (1:05 - 1:30)

**NARRATION:**
> "Every morning, Argus scans a hundred curated sources—not scraped from the open web, but hand-selected and continuously scored for accuracy."

> "See this article? 73% confidence. Why? Because we cross-referenced it against three wire services, checked the source's track record, and flagged the bias. You're not guessing anymore. You're *seeing the work*."

**📹 SCREEN RECORDING SEQUENCE:**
1. Dashboard → Click "Briefings"
2. Show AI briefing with bullet points and confidence scores
3. Click "Deep Verify" on one claim → show verification panel
4. Point out: cross-references, source reliability, verification trail

---

## FEATURE 2: PROTECTING TRUTH-TELLERS (1:30 - 2:05)

**NARRATION:**
> "Now here's where it gets powerful. Meet someone we'll call 'Nightingale.' She's a nurse in a conflict zone. She sees supply shortages the news isn't reporting. She wants to speak—but if anyone traces it back to her, she loses her job. Maybe worse."

> "With Argus, Nightingale registers anonymously—no email, no identity, just a cryptographic key. She submits intel, and zero-knowledge proofs let her *prove* her track record without revealing *who she is*. When her intel checks out, she earns Zcash—payments that can't be traced, frozen, or seized."

> "For the first time, truth-tellers have both *protection* and *incentive*."

**📹 SCREEN RECORDING SEQUENCE:**
1. Navigate to Sources → HUMINT tab
2. Show anonymous sources with codenames and reputation scores
3. Click one profile → show submissions, reputation building over time
4. Go to ZK Proofs page (/zk) → show "Prove Reputation" generating a proof
5. Brief flash of OPSEC guide or wallet setup

---

## FEATURE 3: CURATED INTELLIGENCE MARKETPLACE (2:05 - 2:30)

**NARRATION:**
> "Trust isn't just for sources—it's for curators too. Analysts who spend years building expertise can now package their curated source lists and sell access through NFT passes."

> "Subscribers pay once, get continuous updates. 95% goes directly to the curator. And because it's on-chain, that access pass works across any app in the ecosystem. Expertise becomes portable, verifiable, and *owned*."

**📹 SCREEN RECORDING SEQUENCE:**
1. Navigate to Marketplace
2. Browse listings → show ratings, subscriber counts
3. Click into one listing → show packages
4. Navigate to Manage Sources → "Sell Access" → show package builder with image upload

---

## THE TECH (2:30 - 2:40)

**NARRATION:**
> "Under the hood: NEAR AI for intelligent synthesis. Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving reputation. Zcash for untraceable payments. NFTs for verifiable access. All user-owned—your data never lives on our servers."

**📹 SCREEN RECORDING:**
- Quick flash of ZK page showing "✅ Production Ready"
- Optional: architecture diagram overlay

---

## ROADMAP & CLOSE (2:40 - 3:00)

**NARRATION:**
> "We're live, but we're still building. The trust-scoring algorithm is being refined against real accuracy data. Next up: real-time alerts when critical intel drops, social platform monitoring, and mobile apps."

> "Misinformation wins when trust is broken. Argus rebuilds it—source by source, proof by proof."

> "Own your intelligence. Protect your sources. Visit argus.vitalpoint.ai."

1. **Trust is proven, not assumed** — Sources rise and fall based on accuracy
2. **Truth-tellers are protected** — Anonymous identity + ZK proofs + untraceable payments
3. **Expertise is owned** — Curators monetize knowledge, subscribers get verified access
4. **Decentralized by design** — User-owned data, no central gatekeeper

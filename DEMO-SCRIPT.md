## 💡 TIPS

- **Go slow** — Easier to speed up than fix rushed footage
- **Mouse movements** — Deliberate, not jerky
- **Wait for loads** — Let pages fully render before moving on
- **Clean browser** — No bookmarks bar, no other tabs visible
- **Full screen** — Or at least maximize the window

---

## 🎬 AFTER RECORDING

Send me the raw footage and I'll:
1. Add voiceover narration
2. Add captions
3. Add transitions/music
4. Cut to ~3 min final

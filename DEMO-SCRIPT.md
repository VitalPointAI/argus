# Argus Demo Script (3 Minutes)

*Target: ~450 words @ 150 wpm*

---

## OPENING HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

**NARRATION:**
> "Every morning, you wake up to a thousand voices fighting for your attention. Some are true. Some are lies. Most are noise. What if you had a trusted analyst cutting through it all—delivering only what matters, verified and ready to act on?"

**📹 SCREEN RECORDING:**
- *Use stock footage or skip screen recording here*
- *Alternative: Quick montage of Twitter/news sites with overwhelming content*

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:40)

**NARRATION:**
> "Intelligence professionals, researchers, and decision-makers face the same problem: too much information, too little trust. Mainstream platforms are censored. Alternative sources are scattered. And the people with real on-the-ground knowledge? They can't speak up without risking everything."

> "The information you need exists. It's just buried, fragmented, or silenced."

**📹 SCREEN RECORDING:**
- *Stock footage or skip — this is context-setting*

## FEATURE 1: DAILY STRATEGIC SCAN (1:00 - 1:25)

> "With Argus, Viktor submits intel anonymously through zero-knowledge proofs. His identity stays hidden. His reputation builds over time. And when his intel proves accurate, he earns Zcash payments that can't be traced or frozen."
